    Difficulties
====================
Score increase is how much speed you get per apple, the higher the difficulty the more score increase.

Right click on "owo snek.py" and do "Open with Notepad++". Once it is loaded, go to Line 36. It will show all difficulties and
their score increase. Line 36 should be the current difficulty, edit the string (anything inside "").
You MUST keep all capitals the same to the difficulty you want or it will not work!

To add a difficulty add it like so from line 24:
difficulties = {
	"CUSTOM_DIFF_NAME": SCORE_INCREASE # e.g EASY difficulty has 1 score increase.
}

The suggested difficulty in game is NORMAL, HARD, or INSANE as the ones after are designed to be unbeatable for
fun.

Also, in game you can use [ or ] to increase/decrease the score increase in the middle of a game, however this will override your
difficulty to "Custom"

    Save & Load
====================
Your save data is located in "save.json". Please do not move, rename or rewrite any of that data, for
multiple reasons;
	1. You may break the save (Not fixable without knowledge of the save data method.)
	2. If it is moved or renamed the script will not be able to find the save file, it is only searching for
	   "save.json"
	3. If you do wish to rewrite it, please consult someone who does understand the save data, however
	   your best bet is probably me (Jasper) as I made the game
	4. Some things may be able to be rewritten easily (Score, Fruit Location, Speed or Direction) but please
	   refrain from doing so, the game is designed to be fun and cheating ruins the game.

When you press Q in the middle of a game, your data will save, however if you lose a match at any time your
save will be overwritten to the default and be random once more.

Difficulty does NOT save however it will tell you if your difficulty is different from the one you last played the
save with.

To load the game simply boot up the game, and it will load automatically!

   Crash Reports
====================
In the event of a crash please, first attempt to run 'fixSave.pyw' and running the game after the 'fixSave.pyw' has
finished running. You will be notified of this when the 'FixSaveLog.log' file is created and shown!
